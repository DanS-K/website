              <h3>CODING</h3>
              <p> I started to learn web development in 2019 beginning with HTML and CSS and I'm now 
                studying JavaScript and Node JS. I built this website for myself in 2020 and have also 
                built a site for Kent based band <a href="#">Next to Mountains.</a> I've studied Art & 
                Design at various levels and am using these skills to help me build more eye-catching 
                websites and applications. I'm available for any front-end web development jobs and look
                forward to helping you create a beautiful, bespoke and responsive site to meet your needs.

            <h3>ART</h3>
            <p> I've been drawing, painting and creating art all my life. My inspiration always came from 
              a love of fantasy, horror and old movies. Since moving to the great British countryside in 2019
              my art work has definitely softened and has taken on more of a rural feel.  I have done several 
              art commissions from company logos to tattoo designs. For my full range of work please visit my 
               portfolio page or <a href="#">instagram</a>.

            <h3>HOBBIES</h3>
            <p> I am an 80's obsessed geek at heart. I have a huge love for collecting 80's pop culture 
            memorabilia, movie soundtracks on vinyl and retro video games. When not busy learning code or 
            sketching, I can usually be found with an NES controller in hand playing Ninja Gaiden or scouring 
            eBay for more Garbage Pail Kids cards. I will be starting a blog soon to talk about this a little 
            more.

      <!--ABOUT ME-->
      <section class="about-me" id="about">
        <h2 class="section__about">Who I am!</h2>
        <p class="section__subtitle__about"> Artist & Coder based in Kent UK</p>

        <div class="about-me__body">
          <p> I’m Dan. 80’s enthusiast, retro gamer, artist, vegetable gardener and coding student. 
            I’m on a mission to become a professional programmer and have made this website to document my journey, 
            practice my coding skills and showcase my art.</p>

 

          <p>My step into coding began in 2019 when my father-in-law who works in the field suggested I look into it. 
            I was seeking a career change and this felt like a light bulb turned on in my head! 
            I’m logical, analytical but also creative - programming seemed like the perfect fit for me. </p>
            
             
            
          <p> I was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis 15 years ago. 
            This had a huge impact on every part of my life and remains a daily challenge for me. 
            I’ve been in a role that works for me physically but doesn’t challenge me enough mentally. 
            With my physical health, I’d always felt restricted with career options but can see that programming will really work for me.
            Earlier this year, my learning journey really escalated after I was furloughed due to the risks associated with my condition. 
            Every day, I’m learning so much about the way that programming works and I’m absolutely loving it! So far, 
            I’ve gained a great grasp of HTML, CSS and Java Script, I’m now looking at back-end coding starting with Node. 
            One of the things I love the most is when I make something work and truly understand how its happened. 
            I now want to do this more and more! </p>
            
             
            
          <p>I’ve made several functioning games and will upload more of these in the coming weeks as I learn more and more. 
            I’ll also upload blog posts to chart my progress and remind me of how far I’ve come on a more challenging day!
            I’m always looking for new projects, so if you like what you see and would like me to build you a website or 
            send you a piece of my art - please contact me <a href="mailto:dansendall-king@yahoo.co.uk"> here.</a>
